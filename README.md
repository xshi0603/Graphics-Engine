# Graphics-Engine

## Stuyvesant High School

## Created by: Xing Tao Shi

This graphic engine creates a gif of a expanding, spinning sphere. The shape that is created is dependent on the contents of the file *simple_anim.mdl*.

## How to run it:

In order to run this program, first clone the repo onto your local machine. Then, locate and enter the folder and type the following command:

```
make
```

After doing this, the program will create a file called *simple.gif*. Use your computer's local gif viewer in order to view the created file.
